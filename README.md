Facial Expression Recognition project done via Pytorch
Transfer Learning using ResNEt and VGG CNN's 

Facial expression recognition: This project is to develop a machine learning model to identify
and categorize emotional expressions depicted on a human face. The following website is a
good source for you to understand this topic. Students can use the dataset provided on the
website and shall systematically investigate how good the developed model works.
